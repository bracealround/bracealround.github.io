*"The capacity to learn is a gift; the ability to learn is a skill; the willingness to learn is a choice."*  
— Brian Herbert

I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida, working in the Computational Biology & Machine Learning Lab.

How can we apply the power of large language models beyond natural language? Can the same architectures that excel at understanding human text also decode the language of life—genomic sequences, protein structures, and the complex regulatory mechanisms that govern cellular processes? If so: how do we adapt these models to capture biological semantics? How can we leverage them to accelerate drug discovery and cancer research? — these are some of the key questions I am exploring in my research.

Broadly, I apply **deep learning and NLP techniques to computational biology**, building on my foundation in Natural Language Processing to tackle problems in **genomics, proteomics, and cancer research**. I am particularly interested in using genome language models and diffusion models to understand post-transcriptional gene regulation and predict protein structures and functions.

Before starting my PhD, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at REVE Systems, where I developed production-ready NLP systems for Bangla, a low-resource language. I also taught at the University of Asia Pacific. I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), graduating with distinction.

Feel free to reach out to me if you would like to chat about research, collaboration, or if you have any questions about my work.
