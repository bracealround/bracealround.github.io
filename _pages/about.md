I'm a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida, with research focused at the intersection of computational biology, machine learning, and cancer research. My work builds on a foundation in Natural Language Processing, where I now apply large language models to biological data — moving from genomic sequences to protein structures and function prediction.
Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at REVE Systems, where I developed production-ready NLP systems for Bangla, a low-resource language. I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science & Engineering at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), graduating with distinction (CGPA: 3.79/4.00).
Research Interests
I'm particularly interested in applying core NLP techniques to problems outside traditional language domains — including genomics, proteomics, and medical applications. My broader research interests span:

Computational Biology & Bioinformatics: Genome language models, alternative polyadenylation, isoform detection, protein modeling
Cancer Research: Applying ML methods to cancer genomics and therapeutic discovery
Deep Learning: Transformer architectures, diffusion models, and their applications to biological sequences
Natural Language Processing: Low-resource languages, Bangla NLP, and transfer learning
Computer Vision & Image Forensics: Visual analysis and authenticity verification
Computational Medicine: Medical applications of machine learning and survival analysis

Current Work
I'm currently working on applying genome language models to predict alternative polyadenylation sites, with a paper under review at the Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal. My research also involves diffusion language models in proteomics and maintaining tools for alternative splicing and polyadenylation analysis at the Computational Biology & Machine Learning Lab.
I have contributed to a comprehensive survey on computational methods for alternative polyadenylation and splicing, published in Nature's Experimental & Molecular Medicine.
Past Projects
My work has consistently focused on real-world, impactful applications of machine learning, including:

Violence and hate speech detection in social media
Grammar and spelling correction for low-resource languages
Malware classification systems
Paraphrase detection and semantic similarity
Named entity recognition for multilingual contexts
Survival analysis applications

Teaching & Service
I serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at UCF for Introduction to Computer Concepts. Previously, I taught as a Lecturer at the University of Asia Pacific, where I instructed courses in Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Software Development.
I actively contribute to the research community as a reviewer for ISMB 2025 and the Second Workshop on Bangla Language Processing (IJCNLP-AACL 2025). I also organized the first shared task on Violence-Inciting Text Detection at the BLP Workshop @ EMNLP 2023, which attracted 27 participating teams and resulted in 16 accepted papers.
Let's Collaborate
I'm always open to interdisciplinary collaboration — especially in computational biology, protein modeling, cancer research, and novel applications of LLMs to biological systems and drug discovery. If you're working in these areas (or have adjacent interests), feel free to reach out!
